## What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to use React to build an interactive web application. I gained experience in managing state with hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`), handling user inputs, and creating reusable components. Additionally, I learned how to style components using CSS and how to handle side effects such as copying text to the clipboard.
